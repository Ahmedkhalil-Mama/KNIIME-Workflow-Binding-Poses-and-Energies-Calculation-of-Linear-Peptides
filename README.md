# Aims
[Go to the top](#Table-of-contents)

This KNIME workflow streamlines the docking of linear peptides ([not exeeding 500 atoms and 100 rotatables bonds](https://support.schrodinger.com/s/article/1020)) to the chromatography resin TOYOPEARL MX-Trp-650M and computes their binding free energies in a fully automated fashion. By integrating directly with [Schrödinger's](https://www.schrodinger.com/) tools, it identifies the most favorable poses within a prepared binding site and calculates their relative energetics. The resulting scores and energy values provide key insights into how different pepetides bind, facilitating rational design or selection of peptides in chromatography and related applications. Because all steps are encapsulated within [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/), researchers can run complex simulations through a graphical interface without extensive programming or computational chemistry expertise. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A valid **Schrödinger license** is required to run this workflow. The license must include the following modules: Canvas, ConfGen, Core Hopping, Epik, Glide, Impact, Jaguar, Jaguar pKa, LigPrep, MacroModel, P450 SOM Prediction, Prime, PrimeX, QikProp, QSite, and SiteMap. Additionally, the Maestro, KNIME, and OPLS access licenses are also required.

### Requirements

In order to run this KNIME workflow the following software are needed:
- Schrödinger 2023-2 (or newer version)
- KNIME 4.7.1 (or newer version)

In addition to this repository, you can find the KNIME workflow on the KNIME Hub at this link: https://hub.knime.com/ballweti/spaces/Public/Binding%20Poses%20and%20Energies%20Calculation~bPcNwd0wgw5zvWH3/current-state. Importing the workflow from the Hub into KNIME is straightforward—simply drag and drop it into the software to streamline the upload process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The original results in [Ballweg et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967324004631) were obtained using the software versions: KNIME (4.7.1) and Schrödinger (2023-2).

This section provides an example to help new users execute this KNIME workflow. First, the figure below illustrates a simplified overview of the steps involved.
### Prediction of binding poses and energies: inputs/outputs

  <small>Simplified overview of the KNIME workflow</small>
</p>

To run this workflow, three different input files are required:
-  A SMILES-String file (.smi), which contains the different structures of the target molecules.
  ```
An example of a SMILES-String: C[C@H]([C@@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)N)C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)N)O Octapeptide_2
```
-  A Docking Grid of Adsorbent (.sbc* or .maegz). Both file types can be generated using the _Receptor Grid Generation tool_ on Maestro Schrödinger.
-  Input parameters for the workflow as an Excel sheet (.xlsx)

Examples of the input files are provided in [input](Example/Input)

The Output files consist in:
- A Maestro Project File (.prj), which containts the different binding poses of the target molecules.
- Excel sheets (.xlsx), which containt the different binding energies of the target molecules.

Examples of the stated output files can be found under [output](Example/Output)

*: The substructure file defines the locations of atoms at the outer edges of the resin model. These atoms are "frozen" during the minimization step to preserve the structural integrity of the resin while allowing the rest of the system to relax. The substructure file can be generated manually within the MacroModel Minimization Tool of the Schrödinger’s Maestro software.  An example of the SBC file structure is shown below:

“FXAT    1000      0      0      0    -1.0000     0.0000     0.0000     0.0000

FXAT   10001      0      0      0    -1.0000     0.0000     0.0000     0.0000”

Each line in the file begins with the command FXAT, which directs MacroModel to freeze the designated atom during the minimization process. The second column specifies the atom identifier, and a value of -1.0000 in column six indicates that the atom is fully restrained, ensuring it remains immobile throughout the minimization.
